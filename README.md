CS381/780 - Machine Learning Final Project for Jihoon Oh, Ryan Ramphal, and Don Liu

The main program is in the code file **main.py**. This code is written in Python 2, so you will need a Python 2 interpreter installed on the machine you wish to run this code from.

Once you have Python 2 installed on your machine, open your command line and navigate to the folder containing this project. Then execute the command **python main.py** to run the code. It will print out IV/EV, given a number from k = 1 to k = size of data set.

To run the Python 2 code that was used to generate the statistical data about the k-means clustering execution status, open your command line and navigate to the folder containing this project. Then execute the command **python alt-main.py** to run the code. It will print its output to the command line and halt.

The Dow Jones dataset was taken from: <http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Dow+Jones+Index>

To use the analysis code written in R, a version of R has to be installed.
Be sure to save a copy of the dataset on your desktop prior to executing the R code. To execute, navigate to the folder containing the R code file **rcode.R**. Then, type the command "r -f rcode.R" to run the code and view the output.
